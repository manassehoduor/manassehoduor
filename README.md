**manassehoduor/manassehoduor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on various data science projects, helping clients extract insights from their data and drive data-informed decision-making in their organizations.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R-Shiny, Python, and JavaScript to enhance my skills in developing interactive and visually appealing data visualizations and web applications.

- ğŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source data science projects or opportunities related to data science, rugby performance analysis, or any other interesting domains. If you're interested in hiring me or collaborating with me on a project, please [email me](manassehoduor6@gmail.com).

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about rugby performance analysis, data-driven insights in sports, or any questions related to data science and analytics. 

- ğŸ˜„  Pronouns: He/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've played rugby at a competitive level for quite a number of years and have a deep understanding of the game both as a player and an analyst.
